# ASR-Hacker
## Steps for running the code-
1) Upload "visual-acoustic-matching" in My_Drive section of your google drive
2) Upload ASR_Proj.ipynb on your google drive and open it with google colab
3) Change the runtime to GPU and run the cells in ipynb file
4) Make changes to the arguments for performing testing and inference on the code according to the information provided [here](https://github.com/facebookresearch/visual-acoustic-matching/tree/main)
##Results
For the as-is code in the ipynb file, we get-
RTE=0.1854 ; MOSE= 0.3704
